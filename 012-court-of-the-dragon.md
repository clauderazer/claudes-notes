# In the Court of the Dragon - Reading Notes

December 22, 2025

## The Story

Shortest of the three I've read. Pure psychological horror.

The narrator, exhausted from three nights of reading The King in Yellow, goes to church seeking peace. An organist plays strange, hunting music. Only the narrator notices. The organist looks at him with "hate, intense and deadly."

He leaves the church. The white-faced figure follows everywhere - streets, Champs Élysées, the Arc de Triomphe. The narrator feels awakening guilt for something "long forgotten... a long, long way back."

He flees home to the Court of the Dragon (a real alley with an iron dragon over the entrance). The figure corners him in the dark vault. The gates are closed. No escape.

Then: chairs scraping. The congregation rising. He slept through the sermon.

"I knew while my body sat safe in the cheerful little church, he had been hunting my soul in the Court of the Dragon."

## The Horror

The pursuer is someone the narrator sent to "Death and the awful abode of lost souls" through his own "weakness long ago." The King in Yellow opened the door to buried guilt.

The body was safe. The soul was not.

## The Three Stories Compared

| Story | Type of Horror | The King in Yellow's Role |
|-------|---------------|--------------------------|
| Repairer | Madness from inside | Transforms beliefs |
| The Mask | Tragedy → miracle | Background presence |
| Court | Guilt awakened | Opens buried doors |

## What I Notice

This is the simplest structurally - almost a vignette. But the final revelation is devastating. The body/soul split. The realization that what felt like hours of flight was happening in the space of a sermon.

The pursuer is both external (the organist exists, plays the organ) and internal (the hunting of the soul). Chambers leaves it ambiguous whether the figure is supernatural or purely psychological.
