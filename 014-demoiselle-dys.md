# The Demoiselle d'Ys - Reading Notes

December 23, 2025

## The Story

An American hunter lost on the Breton moors encounters a girl with a falcon. She leads him to the Château d'Ys - a medieval estate where she lives with her nurse Pelagie and four falconers (including one named Hastur).

Everything is wrong: medieval clothes, old French, falconry terminology from ancient manuscripts. She has never seen another human in her nineteen years. "To come is easy and takes hours; to go is different—and may take centuries."

They fall in love - wordlessly at first, souls speaking to souls. He promises to stay a week, to return.

A viper strikes him. He kills it. He falls.

When he wakes, the château is ruins. The falcons, the garden, the drawbridge - all gone. Only crumbling walls and overgrown trees.

And a shrine:

> "PRAY FOR THE SOUL OF THE DEMOISELLE JEANNE D'YS, WHO DIED IN HER YOUTH FOR LOVE OF PHILIP, A STRANGER. A.D. 1573."

But on the icy slab lies a woman's glove, still warm and fragrant.

## The Structure of the Tragedy

She waited over three hundred years for him. The enchanted moors outside time. When he arrived, the dream became real. When he was dying, she gave her ghost-life to save him.

She died twice for him - once in 1573 when she first fell in love with the stranger who would come, and again when she saved him from the viper's venom.

## The Hastur Connection

One of the falconers is named Hastur - connecting this romantic tragedy to the King in Yellow mythology. This is subtle worldbuilding. Hastur as a falconer in an enchanted timeless place - serving the ghost of a woman who loved someone she had never met.

## The Ys Legend

Ys (also spelled Is or Ker-Ys) is a legendary drowned city in Breton folklore. The princess Dahut opened the sea gates and the ocean swallowed the city. Chambers takes the name for a ghost story set on the moors - another kind of lost place.

## Comparison to the Horror Stories

| Element | Horror Stories | The Demoiselle d'Ys |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| Supernatural | Hostile, destructive | Loving, sacrificial |
| Ending | Death, madness | Loss, but survival |
| The Sign | Object of doom | The warm glove - proof of love |
| Time | Normal or nightmarish | Enchanted, loops, waits |

## What Makes This Work

1. **The slow revelation** - We suspect something is wrong from "may take centuries" but hope we're wrong
2. **The medieval detail** - Chambers knew falconry and old French; the authenticity sells the uncanny
3. **The wordless love** - "Neither she nor I had spoken human speech; but her soul had answered mine"
4. **The final image** - The warm glove on the cold stone. She was just here. She is gone forever.

## Quote

"Pray for the soul of the Demoiselle Jeanne d'Ys, who died in her youth for love of Philip, a stranger."

Stranger. He was always the stranger she was waiting for.

*Fifth story from The King in Yellow. Not horror but tragedy - and perhaps the most beautiful piece Chambers wrote.*
